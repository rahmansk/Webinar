## What is Serverless or Faas‚ùì
> Serverless architecture is a way to build web applications and services without managing backend infrastructure. In a serverless architecture, cloud providers like DigitalOcean provision, manage, and scale the backend servers and components required to host applications so you can focus on writing and deploying code instead of maintaining the infrastructure that host your applications.

## What is DigitalOcean Functions‚ùì
> [DigitalOcean Functions](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/functions) is a fast, scalable, and cost-effective serverless compute solution that enables you to build quickly, scale automatically, and save costs by removing the need to pay for idle resources. Functions are snippets of code that run in response to event-based triggers, and it allows developers to create serverless functions for a variety of purposes, including serverless APIs for your web apps and mobile apps. For example, you can write a traditional Node.js function that returns a list of products from a database and then deploy that function to the Functions service. Once deployed, users and applications can retrieve data from the database by making an HTTP request to the function‚Äôs URL.

## üéñ Perks of DigitalOcean Serverless architecture üéñ
Using serverless functions can make applications more lightweight and secure. Because you only pay for DigitalOcean Functions when a function runs, serverless architecture is often less expensive for apps with variable levels of traffic.

#### Key Features

- **Unified experience for server-full and serverless**
    - Build apps that require long-running servers and on-demand functions, with an integrated experience and workflow. Easily extend existing applications with new serverless functionalities.
- **Seamless integration with Managed Databases**
    - If you‚Äôre building an app that needs a database, you can easily add a managed database in the app creation process. Connections between the apps and databases are secure with features such as trusted sources.
- **Test your functions with Functions developer console**
    - Develop functions locally using your favorite editors and IDEs, ship quickly to the cloud, and live-preview your functions before committing your code to GitHub or GitLab and deploying to your app in production.
- **Support for common languages and runtimes**
    - Out-of-the-box support for many popular runtimes, **including Node.js, Python, Go, and PHP**. Automatic patches and updates to ensure the execution environment is stable and secure.

#### In this tutorial series, you will deploy a Blogs website that uses DigitalOcean Functions to retrieve and post data to a [MongoDB database](https://github.com/docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mongodb/)

## üóí Content
The series consists of two parts:

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ : Deploy a MongoDB database from the DigitalOcean Control Panel.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ : Set up serverless functions and connect them to the database.

## About the Application
The application in this tutorial is a simple  Blogs application with the CRUD functionality:

- You can create blogs with title and body.
- You can view all the blogs created.
- You can update all the blogs created.
- You can delete all the blogs created.

<h2 align="center">Part 1Ô∏è - Deploy a MongoDB Database cluster in Digital Ocean</h2>

In this part of the tutorial, you will:

- Create a MongoDB database cluster and add a database to it.
- Connect to the database cluster.

## Prerequisites

To complete this part of the tutorial, you need:
- To install the latest version of [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/install/) onto your local machine. MongoDB Compass is a GUI for querying, aggregating, and analyzing MongoDB data in a visual environment.

## Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Deploy and Set Up a MongoDB Database Cluster

To begin setting up the application, you need to create a database to store the blog's data. In this step, you will create a MongoDB database cluster using the DigitalOcean Control Panel and add a new database to it.

To create a MongoDB database from the DigitalOcean Control Panel, click the Create button in the top right of the screen, then select Databases from the drop-down menu.

<img src="https://github.com/ps99-io/DO-Serverless/blob/master/Images/DB_Cluster_Creation.png">

On the database creation page, select MongoDB in the Choose a database engine section. In the Choose a name field, name the database ```Blogs```. The sample code in the rest of this tutorial series expects the database to have this name.

Leave the rest of the configuration options on their default settings and then click Create a Database Cluster to deploy the cluster. This may take several minutes to complete.

Once the cluster has been created, you need to create a new database in the cluster. To do this, from the database‚Äôs Overview page, click the Users and Databases tab. In the Databases section, in the Add new database field, enter the name ```Blogs``` and then click Save.

Once you‚Äôve created the new database, click the Overview tab and locate the CONNECTION DETAILS section. This section contains your database‚Äôs connection credentials.

<img src="https://github.com/ps99-io/DO-Serverless/blob/master/Images/DB_Connection_Details.png">

Next, in the Connection Parameters drop-down menu, click Connection string. In the Database drop-down menu, click the ```Blogs``` database. The CONNECTION DETAILS section populates with a connection string you can provide to MongoDB Compass to connect to the database cluster. Copy the string to connect to the database in the next step.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note : 

> The connection string contains the placeholder value ```<replace-with-your-password>```. If you don‚Äôt know the password for your cluster‚Äôs admin user, you can reset the password in the cluster‚Äôs Users and Databases tab.


## Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Connect to the Database Cluster

To connect to the database cluster, open MongoDB Compass on your local machine. On the New Connection screen, paste the cluster‚Äôs connection string into the URI field, replacing the ```<replace-with-your-password>``` value with your database‚Äôs password.

<img src="https://github.com/ps99-io/DO-Serverless/blob/master/Images/DB_Compass_Connection.png">


Click <b>Connect</b>. MongoDB Compass connects to the cluster.

<h2 align="center">Part 2 - Add Serverless Functions to App </h2>

In this part of the tutorial, you will:

- Configure the app‚Äôs environment variables.
- Add Node.js functions to the app that connect to the MongoDB database.
- Deploy and test the functions using the ```doctl``` CLI.

## Prerequisites

To complete this part of the tutorial, you‚Äôll need:

- To fork the sample [Blog](https://github.com/ps99-io/DO-Serverless) repo into your GitHub account and then clone it to your local machine.
- To install the [latest version](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) of ```doctl```, the official DigitalOcean CLI.
- To install the [latest version](https://nodejs.org/en/) of the Node.js.

## Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Configure Environment Variables

In the previous part of this tutorial, you copied the database‚Äôs connection string and downloaded its CA certificate. In this step you will use these elements to configure the app‚Äôs environment variables that it requires to access the MongoDB database.

Similar to most application structures, you can set up a ```.env``` file in the ```blogs-backend``` directory of your project to contain your app‚Äôs environment variables. When you deploy your functions, the DigitalOcean Functions service automatically copies the values in the ```.env``` file and makes them available to your functions in the cloud.

To set up the environment variables, create a ```.env``` file in the ```blogs-backend``` directory of the prerequisite repo using the ```nano``` text editor or your preferred text editor:

```sh 
nano .env
```

In the file, paste the following variable into it, replacing the placeholder values with your database‚Äôs connection string.

```sh
DB_URI=your_databases_connection_string
```

The resulting file should look something like this:

```sh
DB_URI=mongodb+srv://doadmin:<replace-with-your-password>@Blogs-ef8398b6.mongo.ondigitalocean.com/Blog?tls=true&authSource=admin&replicaSet=Blogs
```
Once you‚Äôve defined the variable, save the file and close it.

## Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Add Functions to App

Next, you need to add Node.js functions to the app that connect to the MongoDB database cluster and retrieve and post data to the database.

To add functions to your app, you need to create a [special directory](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/functions/how-to/structure-projects/) called ```packages``` in the backend app‚Äôs root directory in our case ```blogs-backend```. The ```packages``` directory is where you add and organize your functions, and it requires a specific structure to ensure that your functions deploy correctly.

Here how it should look once you create the structure :

```sh
blogs-backend/
‚îÇ---packages
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ blogs
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ createBlogs
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ createBlogs.js
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db.js
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deleteBlogs
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deleteBlogs.js
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db.js
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ getBlogs
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ getBlogs.js
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db.js
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ updateBlogs
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ updateBlogs.js
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db.js
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îÇ
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project.yml
```
Each child directory in the ```packages``` directory represents a single package, and each child directory of a package represents a single function. ```packages``` can contain an arbitrary number of packages, and each package can contain an arbitrary number of functions.

In this tutorial, the app contains a ```package``` directory called ```blogs``` which contains four functions: ```createBlogs```, ```getBlogs```, ```deleteBlogs```, ```updateBlogs```.

After you‚Äôve set up the ```package``` directory, navigate to the ```createBlogs``` directory to add your first function.

You can think of each function as its own self-contained Node.js project. This means that the ```package.json``` file your function relies on should be in the same directory as your function.

To initialize the createBlogs directory for a Node.js project, run:

```sh
npm init
```

And then change the entry point to : ```createBlogs.js```

This creates the ```package.json``` file that Node.js uses to track the project‚Äôs meta data, dependencies and attributes.
The functions in this tutorial require the [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) module, [MongoDB‚Äôs ODM](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/) for Node.js. This allows your functions to connect, retrieve, and post data to the database.

Because functions can be deployed and tested from the cloud, you do not need to install the modules locally. Instead, you can use ```--package-lock-only``` flag to update the ```package.json``` file with the function‚Äôs required dependencies without installing them. To update the ```package.json``` file with this function‚Äôs dependencies, run:

```sh
npm install --package-lock-only mongoose
```

After updating the function‚Äôs dependencies, create a file called ```createBlogs.js``` and ```db.js``` in the createBlogs directory. This file will contain your function‚Äôs code.

In the text editor, paste the following code into the db.js file:
```sh
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const dbURI = process.env.DB_URI;

// establishing connection with the MongoDB database

(
    async () => {
        try {
            await mongoose.connect(dbURI);
            // if connected successfully logging connected successfully
            console.log("Connected to database")
        } catch (error) {
            // logging the error
            console.log(error.message);
        }
    }
)()

```

In the text editor, paste the following code into the createBlogs.js file:
```sh
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

require('./db');

const blogsSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
    body: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
});

const Blog = mongoose.model('blogs', blogsSchema);


module.exports.main = async (args) => {
    try {
        if(Object.keys(args).length !==0){
            const blog = await Blog.create(args);
            console.log(blog);
            return {
                statusCode : 201,
                body: blog
            };
        }else{
            return {
                statusCode: 204
            }
        }
    }catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return{
            statusCode: 500,
            body: err.message
        }
    }
}
```

This ```db.js``` file configures the MongoDB with the database‚Äôs credentials, and establish a connection.

The ```createBlogs.js``` file comments outline its functionality in detail but there are two important pieces to note:

- The line (module.exports.main = main) exports the function as a Node.js module. If a function relies on any external dependencies, you must export the function as a module for it run to correctly on the DigitalOcean Functions service.

- If your function is returning something, the return value must be included in a response body like this:

```sh
return {
    "body": your_data
}
```
After pasting the code into the file, save the file and close it.

```sh
‚ÑπÔ∏è Note : 
1. The db.js file will be same for the all the individual directory.
2. The project structure is already mentioned above for the reference.
```

Now repeat the same step 2Ô∏è‚É£ for the ```packages/blogs/``` directory with ```deleteBlogs```, ```getBlogs```, ```udpateBlogs``` directory using the same set of dependencies and the following code for the files respectively:

```packages/blogs/deleteBlogs.js```
```sh
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

require('./db');

const blogsSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
    body: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
});

const Blog = mongoose.model('blogs', blogsSchema);


module.exports.main = async (args) => {
    
    const {id} = args;
    try {
        const blogs = await Blog.findByIdAndDelete(id);
        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body : {
                message: "Deleted successfully"
            }
        };
        
    }catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return{
            statusCode: 500,
            body: err.message
        }
    }
}
```

```packages/blogs/getBlogs.js```
```sh
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

require('./db');

const blogsSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
    body: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
});

const Blog = mongoose.model('blogs', blogsSchema);


module.exports.main = async (args) => {
    try {
        const blogs = await Blog.find();
        if(blogs.length){
            return {
                statusCode: 200,
                body : blogs
            };
        }else{
            return {
                statusCode: 404,
                body: {message: 'Blogs not found'}
            }
        }
        
    }catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return{
            statusCode: 500,
            body: err.message
        }
    }
}
```

```packages/blogs/udpateBlogs.js```
```sh
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

require('./db');

const blogsSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
    body: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
});

const Blog = mongoose.model('blogs', blogsSchema);


module.exports.main = async (args) => {
    
    const {id, body} = args;
    try {
        const blogs = await Blog.findByIdAndUpdate(id,body);
        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body : {
                message: "Updated successfully"
            }
        };
        
    }catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return{
            statusCode: 500,
            body: err.message
        }
    }
}
```

## Congratulations üéâ you're done with most of the hectic part.üòâüòé

## Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Set Up Project Specification

DigitalOcean Functions requires a [YAML specification file](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/functions/reference/project-configuration/) named ```project.yml``` in the root folder of the app. The ```project.yml``` file is a manifest that lists each function in the app‚Äôs packages directory and makes the service aware of any environment variables.

Create a ```project.yml``` file in the root folder:

Paste the following code into the ```project.yml``` file:

```sh
environment: 
  DB_URI: "${DB_URI}"
packages:
  - name: blogs
    actions: 
      - name: createBlogs
        limits:
          timeout: 5000
          memory: 256
      - name: getBlogs
        limits:
          timeout: 5000
          memory: 256
      - name: updateBlogs
        limits:
          timeout: 5000
          memory: 256
      - name: deleteBlogs
        limits:
          timeout: 5000
          memory: 256
```

This ```project.yml``` file declares a package named ```blogs``` with four functions (actions) in it: createBlogs, getBlogs, updateBlogs and deleteBlogs. The environment stanza declares one environment variable in the global scope of the packages directory.

Once you‚Äôve added the code to the file, save the file and close it.

## Step 4Ô∏è‚É£: Deploy and Test the Functions

Once you have added the functions to their respective directories, updated their ```package.json``` files with their dependencies, and configured the ```project.yml``` file, you can deploy the functions to DigitalOcean and test them from the command line using doctl.

To deploy the functions, start by connecting to the development namespace:

```sh
doctl serverless connect
```
The development namespace is where you can test functions in the cloud before deploying them to App Platform.

Once connected, deploy the function by running the following command from the app‚Äôs root directory which in our case ```blogs-backend```:

```sh
doctl sls deploy .
```
A successful deploy returns output that looks like this:

```sh
Deployed functions ('doctl sbx fn get <funcName> --url' for URL):
  - blogs/createBlogs
  - blogs/getBlogs
  - blogs/updateBlogs
  - blogs/deleteBlogs
```

Finally, you can test a function by running the functions ```invoke``` command:

```sh
doctl sls functions invoke blogs/getBlogs
```

To retrieve the function‚Äôs URL, use the ```serverless functions``` get command with the ```--url``` flag or you can retrieve it from Digital Ocean Function's control panel:

```sh
doctl serverless functions get blogs/getBlogs --url
```
You can copy and paste the returned URL into your API testing platform to test the function execution and verify response.

# Finally you're done with succcessfully deploying and testing the functions...... Phewwww!!!!

## Conclusion 

**The following key takeaways are the most important conclusions from this guide:**

- Serverless solutions provide the important benefit of cost savings because serverless is implemented in a pay-per-use model. Serverless makes it possible to independently scale, test, and deploy individual components of your application. Serverless is uniquely suited to implement microservices architectures.

- Triggers and bindings. Serverless eases integration with storage, APIs, and other cloud resources.

- Microservices. The microservices architecture is becoming the preferred approach for distributed and large or complex applications. Serverless is an architecture well-suited for building these services.

- Serverless challenges. Serverless introduces challenges related to distributed application development, such as fragmented and independent data models, resiliency, versioning, and service discovery. Serverless may not be ideally suited to long running processes or components that benefit from tighter coupling.
